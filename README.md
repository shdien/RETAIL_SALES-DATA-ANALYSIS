# **üìåProject Overview**

This project demonstrates end-to-end retail sales data analysis using SQL.
It includes data cleaning, exploration, and analytical queries to generate valuable business insights such as top customers, best-selling months, sales by category, and shift-based order analysis.
The dataset represents transactional retail sales data containing sales dates, times, customer demographics, product categories, and sales amounts.

# **‚öôSQL Workflow**

**(1). Data Cleaning**

Identify and remove rows with NULL values.


**(2). Data Exploration**

Count total sales transactions.

Find unique customers.

List distinct product categories.


**(3). Data Analysis**

Filter sales by specific date, month, and category.

Calculate sales metrics such as:

Total sales & orders per category.

Average customer age by category.

High-value transactions (>1000).

Sales distribution by gender and category.

Best-selling month per year.

Top 5 customers by total sales.

Unique customers per category.

Shift-based transaction counts (Morning, Afternoon, Evening).
